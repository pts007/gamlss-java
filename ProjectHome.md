Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) are (semi) parametric regression type models. They are parametric, in that they require a parametric distribution assumption for the response variable, and "semi" in the sense that the modelling of the parameters of the distribution, as functions of explanatory variables, may involve using non-parametric smoothing functions.
